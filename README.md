# Getting Started with JobScout

### Hello Everyone, especially recruiters!

Just kidding—sort of.  
Last summer, I found myself deep in the job hunt within the tech industry, applying to various companies. Along the way, I encountered several job boards that were challenging to navigate, sparking an idea: What if I could create an application that aggregates job listings from various websites, but with a more intuitive search and filtering system?

That’s how Job Scout was born. I decided to start by integrating the API from Arbeitnow, a platform offering numerous job opportunities in Germany. But this is just the beginning—I plan to incorporate APIs from other websites to expand the job listings even further.

For the frontend, I’m using React.js, and I’m planning to implement Node.js for the backend. MongoDB will serve as the database to manage all the job data efficiently.

This project is still in the early stages of development, as I’m working on it alongside my part-time job and studies. Below, you’ll find all the commands you need to run the project.

And that’s the story behind Job Scout.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
